## Business Problem Statement
Buying a home, especially in a city like Bengaluru, is a tricky choice. While the major factors are usually the same for all metros, there are others to be considered for the Silicon Valley of India. With its help millennial crowd, vibrant culture, great climate and a slew of job opportunities, it is difficult to ascertain the price of a house in Bengaluru. As a result, this projects consists of predicting the house prices in Bengaluru, India using a dataset of more than 10000 records.

## Data
Data Source : Kaggle.

## Used Libraries and Resources
**Python Version** : 3.6

**Libraries** : sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, flask, json, pickle

## Data Cleaning
The interesting thing of this project is that the data is really dirty and has many outliers. So it needs to do a lot of feature engineering to prepare for a machine learning model. I made the following changes :
Based on domain knowledge I removed columns that are not relevant for prediction


⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## Bug / Feature Request

If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an [issue](https://github.com/Mandal-21/Flight-Price-Prediction/issues) here by including your search query and the expected result

## Future Scope

* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Front-End
